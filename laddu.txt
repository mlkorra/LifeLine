Hey Laddu,

U are probably the best gift my mom have given me(Other than myself).
I still remember the day u were born in Port Hospital,and the chaos taking place in my house(yeah,my house bcoz by the time u haven't born).

FLASH  After some years....
(Because I dont know exactly happened in the mean time)

We both used to stay alone in the home,when mom and dad left for work,I remember we used to play games and stuff with pillows on bed and had done random #chutiyapa.

But unfortunately(or fortunately) we used to quarrel, I would then Beat u(harder than Belt) and u used to 
call Mummy and complained about me and  I used to feel sorry afterwards for what I did.
Mom used to tell ,"How would u survive as Brother and Sister?If u cant help each other?"
Me :

.....
But the Same Repeats again and again.


I used to annoy u by asking questions like "Whom do u like more?Me or Murali or Harsha?",and as usual ur answer would hurt me(Bcoz the answer is not me)


FLASH After many years......................
Things were not the same as before as I started realizing the small and tiny things as a Person.
But then "New Year Thing" happened in Central Park,which is definitely my fault.One of the worst disturbance i have created,which has a great impact on me.  


Though u were grownup,I always feel as a cute child who constanly is curious but doesnt care mostly about others activities(which i like).

#Kya yaar Serioous ho gaya kya,peace maar na.

Be like child as were Mama,chase and drag ur dreams in to reality Mama.Explore the World of ur "Choice and Desires" and achieve "HAPPINESS" .These are the advices i can(though u  can ignore) + The advices I already gave in the holidays(though u ignored).I would be more happy when u dont depend on others in the JOURNEY(yeh tho deep hain).

#Kaiku -- K R Dev
